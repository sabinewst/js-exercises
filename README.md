# JavaScript exercises
Some JavaScript exercises from the Zero to Mastery course on Udemy.

Currently contains:

Exercise 1: Clean the room function: given an input of [1,2,4,591,392,391,2,5,10,2,1,1,1,20,20], make a function that organizes these into individual array that is ordered. For example answer(ArrayFromAbove) should return: [[1,1,1,1],[2,2,2], 4,5,10,[20,20], 391, 392,591]. Bonus: Make it so it organizes strings differently from number types. i.e. [1, "2", "3", 2] should return [[1,2], ["2", "3"]]

Exercise 2: Write a javascript function that takes an array of numbers and a target number. The function should find two different numbers in the array that, when added together, give the target number. For example: answer([1,2,3], 4)should return [1,3]
